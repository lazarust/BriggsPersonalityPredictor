The goal of this project was to make a model that could parse text and guess what Myers Briggs Personality type they are.Using the data from this Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/tapanvijay/myers-briggs-personality-cleaned

## Results
Current results have approxametly a 20% accuracy, which means there is definte room for improvement. 

## Things Learned
Through this project I learned how to embed text into vectors. Then I used those vectors through the model to evaluate a personality type.
